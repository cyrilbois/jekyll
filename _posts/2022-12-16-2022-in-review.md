As the year draws to a close, we have much to celebrate at Programming Historian HQ! During 2022 we have proudly reached the milestone of publishing our [200th lesson](https://doi.org/10.46430/phen0103), with over 30 of those in [Portuguese](https://programminghistorian.org/pt/). Further to this, in the past year we have:

Started publishing a series devised in collaboration with Jisc and The National Archives (UK). The lessons explore computational analysis of large-scale digital collections and can be found at: https://programminghistorian.org/en/jisc-tna-partnership

We achieved a Programming Historian first, an [English translation](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/introduction-map-warper) from a [Spanish original](https://programminghistorian.org/es/lecciones/introduccion-map-warper) tutorial!

We have started to organise activities to our community of digital humanities educators, learners and project partners. To keep informed of what’s on please visit:

Last, but not least, we have also moved closer to our sustainability goal – our growing [Institutional Partner Programme](https://programminghistorian.org/en/supporters) enables us to continue to produce high-quality digital humanities learning resources delivered free of charge to users around the world!
