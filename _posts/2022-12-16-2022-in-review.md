As the year draws to a close, we have much to celebrate at _Programming Historian_ HQ!  

During 2022 we have proudly reached the milestone of publishing our [200th lesson](https://doi.org/10.46430/phen0103), with over 30 of those in [Portuguese](/pt/licoes/).

Further to this, we've started publishing a series of lessons initiated in collaboration with Jisc and The National Archives (UK) which explore computational analysis of large-scale digital collections. The set will comprise seven original lessons across Portuguese, French and English, as well as localised translations across all four of our publication languages. We're collating [a list of the titles as they are published](/en/jisc-tna-partnership).

Also in the past year, we have achieved a _Programming Historian_ first, an [English translation](/en/lessons/introduction-map-warper) from a [Spanish original](/es/lecciones/introduccion-map-warper) tutorial!

In the last quarter of 2022, we launched a programme of activities to support our community of digital humanities educators, learners and project partners. To find out about upcoming events and catch up on any you've missed, visit [our Events page](/en/events) or [follow us on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/programming-historian-56887654463).

Last, but not least, we have also moved closer to our sustainability goal. Our growing network of [Partners](/en/supporters) provide invaluable support that empowers us to continue producing high-quality, diamond open access, multilingual learning resources. Sincere thanks to all those [individuals](/en/supporters#individual-supporters) and [institutions](/en/supporters#institutional-partners) who have joined or renewed their memberships this year. We are grateful to each and every contributor: your investment makes our work possible. Find out more about making [a personal donation](/en/individual) or joining our [Institutional Partnership Programme](/en/ipp) via our website, or [write to us directly](mailto:community@programminghistorian.org). We're looking forward to building upon our achievements in 2023 and beyond!
